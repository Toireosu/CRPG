# GAME TRIANGLE

## Vision
* An old school CRPG with a modern touch.
* CRPG
* Faster, strategic, charming. 

## Constraints
* Single person team.
* Needs great arcitechture.
* Needs good art style.

## Pillars
* Game should be difficult but fair.
* A new player should be able to complete the game "without saves".
* Different players should be able to experience the game differently.
* No soft or hard locking.
* Easy bartering.
* Urgency, the game should not (always) wait for you.
* Free player movement, minimal hand-holding.
* The player should not be able to see what comes next. 
* The player should be able to go anywhere unless there is a good reason not to (e.g. a cliff).
* The player should not have to rely on save-scumming. Auto-save should exist. 
* The randomness should be the same, so that a player can never rely on a "bad" roll and just reloading from a save.
